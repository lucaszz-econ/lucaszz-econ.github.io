* Cross-Validated Conditional Density Estimation and Nonparametric Continuous Difference-in-Differences Models. 

   **Abstract**: In this paper, we study the conditional density estimation based on a representation using the orthonormal series expansion. In this series representation, each term takes the form of a multiplication of the basis term and its conditional expectation. For high-dimensional conditioning variables with suitable structures, these conditional expectations can be estimated using various machine learning methods. We propose a data-driven method of selecting the series terms based on a modified cross-validation procedure and we establish an oracle inequality on the estimation error of such estimator. The conditional densities have a wide range of applications in various fields in economics, and we add to this literature a new application of nonparametric difference-in-differences models with continuous treatments. For this application, we establish the identification, estimation, and inference results under the double/debiased machine learning framework, and we illustrate our methods by revisiting an empirical study (Duflo (2001)) of a large policy intervention in Indonesia.

* Approximate Sparsity Class and Minimax Estimation. (Under revision. See [[link]](/notes/minimax_joe.pdf) for an older version.)

   **Abstract**: Motivated by the orthogonal series density estimation in $L^2([0,1],\mu)$, in this project we consider a new class of functions that we call the approximate sparsity class. This new class is characterized by the rate of decay of the individual Fourier coefficients for a given orthonormal basis. We establish the $L^2([0,1],\mu)$ metric entropy of such class, with which we show the minimax rate of convergence. For the density subset in this class, we propose an adaptive density estimator based on a hard-thresholding procedure that achieves this minimax rate up to a $\log$ term.
