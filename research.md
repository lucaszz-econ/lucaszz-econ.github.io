* Cross-Validated Conditional Density Estimation and Nonparametric Continuous Difference-in-Differences Models. [[link]](/notes/JMP.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

   **Abstract**: his paper studies high-dimensional conditional density estimation based on a series representation. In this series representation, each term takes the form of a multiplication of a known function and its conditional expectation. These conditional expectations can be estimated using various machine learning methods for high-dimensional conditioning variables with suitable structures. We propose a data-driven method of selecting the series terms based on a modified cross-validation procedure, and we establish an oracle inequality on the estimation error of such an estimator. Conditional densities have a wide range of applications in various fields of economics, and we add to this literature a new application to nonparametric difference-in-differences models with continuous treatments. For this application, we establish identification, estimation, and inference results under the double/debiased machine learning framework, and we illustrate our methods by revisiting an empirical study by Duflo (2001) on a large policy intervention in Indonesia.

* Approximate Sparsity Class and Minimax Estimation. (Under revision. See [[link]](/notes/minimax_joe.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for an older version.)

   **Abstract**: Motivated by the orthogonal series density estimation in $L^2([0,1],\mu)$, in this project we consider a new class of functions that we call the approximate sparsity class. This new class is characterized by the rate of decay of the individual Fourier coefficients for a given orthonormal basis. We establish the $L^2([0,1],\mu)$ metric entropy of such class, with which we show the minimax rate of convergence. For the density subset in this class, we propose an adaptive density estimator based on a hard-thresholding procedure that achieves this minimax rate up to a $\log$ term.
